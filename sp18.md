## **Club meetings**
Spring 2018 meetings will take place every **Thursday from 5:00PM to 6:30PM at ATC-109**. See you there!
This semester, we'll be creating a variety of C++ utility programs and web scrapers as well as working with a local startup, Acutulus Enterprises, to create a web application as a tie-in to one of their projects.
