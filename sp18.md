This semester, we'll be creating a variety of C++ utility programs and web scrapers as well as working with a local startup, Acutulus Enterprises, to create a web application as a tie-in to one of their projects.

Hi my name is Arvin. I am a first year computer science student interested in software development. I obtained a BS in Neurobiology, Physiology, & Behavior at UC Davis and was about to apply to medical school, but realized the career path wasn't for me. I am currently in the process of figuring out what career I want to pursue. [Find me on Github!](https://github.com/arvinshen)
